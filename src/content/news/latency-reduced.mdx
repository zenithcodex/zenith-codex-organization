# Latency Reduced by 40% in Core Grid

Through a series of aggressive optimizations in our event handling system, we have managed to reduce the average round-trip time (RTT) across the Core Grid by approximately **40%**.

## Optimization Strategy

1.  **Zero-Copy Networking**: We removed several unnecessary buffer copies in the packet processing pipeline.
2.  **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Migrated critical state management to lock-free queues, reducing thread contention.
3.  **IO-Uring Adoption**: Switched to `io_uring` for asynchronous I/O operations on supported Linux kernels.
