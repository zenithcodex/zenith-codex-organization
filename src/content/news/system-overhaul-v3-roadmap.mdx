# System Overhaul: Version 3.0 Roadmap

We are approaching the event horizon. Version 3.0 is not just an update; it is a rebirth of the Zenith Codex architecture.

## The Three Pillars of v3.0

1.  **Ommni-Chain Interoperability**: Breaking down the silos between blockchains. One interface for all assets.
2.  **Autonomous DAO Governance**: The code will govern itself. AI agents will propose and vote on parameter adjustments based on real-time market data.
3.  **Holographic UI**: Preparing our visual stack for the next generation of MR (Mixed Reality) devices.

## Timeline

*   **Q3 2024**: Alpha testing of the Governance AI.
*   **Q4 2024**: Public testnet for Omni-Chain Bridge.
*   **Q1 2025**: Official v3.0 Mainnet Launch.

## Call to Arms

We need the best minds to make this a reality. If you are a Rust engineer, a Solidity wizard, or a UI visionary, check our `Active Protocols` section.

The future is not written. It is coded.
