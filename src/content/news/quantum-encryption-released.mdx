# Quantum Encryption Module Released

We are proud to announce the release of the **Quantum Encryption Module (QEM)** for the Zenith Codex ecosystem. This update marks a significant milestone in our roadmap towards full quantum resistance.

## Key Features

- **Lattice-based Cryptography**: Utilizing Kyber-1024 parameters for key encapsulation mechanisms.
- **Hybrid Key Exchange**: Implementing a hybrid model combining classical ECDH with post-quantum algorithms to ensure security against both current and future threats.
- **Performance Optimization**: Despite the heavy mathematical operations, our Rust-based implementation ensures minimal latency overhead (< 2ms additional handshake time).

## Implementation Details

The module has been rigorously audited by our security operations team. We invite the community to review the source code in the `hyperion-core` repository.

```rust
fn initialize_quantum_layer() -> Result<(), CryptoError> {
    let params = QuantumParams::new(SecurityLevel::High);
    let keypair = generate_keypair(&params)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## What's Next?

Phase 2 will focus on integrating these protections into our P2P networking layer.
