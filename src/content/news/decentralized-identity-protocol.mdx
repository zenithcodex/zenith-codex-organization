# Decentralized Identity Protocol

Identity on the old web was broken. Fragmented. Owned by corporations. Today, we launch our **Sovereign ID Protocol (SIP)**.

## The Problem

Your digital existence is currently rented. Platforms can revoke your access at any time. SIP changes this by anchoring your identity to an immutable ledger that *you* control.

## Technical Specs

*   **DID Compliance**: Fully compatible with W3C Decentralized Identifier standards.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove you are over 18 or a citizen of a specific region without revealing your birthdate or address.
*   **Cross-Chain**: Works seamlessly across Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos.

> "Identity is the final frontier of digital freedom."

### Integration Guide

Developers can integrate SIP into their dApps using our lightweight SDK.

```typescript
import { ZenithID } from '@zenith-codex/sip-sdk';

const user = await ZenithID.connect();
if (user.hasCredential('VerifiableDeveloper')) {
    grantAccess('AdminPanel');
}
```

Join the revolution. Reclaim yourself.
